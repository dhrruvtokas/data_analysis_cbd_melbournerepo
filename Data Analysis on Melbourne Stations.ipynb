    "1. Data Integration: The provided seven datasets were combined into a single dataset [`Section 7`]\n",
    "2. Data Data Reshaping: Several transformation/normalisation methods (`Root Tranformation`, `Power Tranformation`, `Log Transfomation`, `Z-Score Tranformation`, and `MinMax Tranformation`) were briefly studied and explained [`Section 8`]. Then the resulting values were then used to `predict` the `property price` of each property by using a `Linear Model`.\n",

    "1. Root Transformation: This transformation was performed by using `np.sqrt()` function to determine the `postive square root` value of the `input data value`. The resulting `tranformed` value of each property was a `float type`.\n",
    "2. Power Transformation: This transformation technique (performed using `np.power()` function) is similar to that of `Box-cox` transformation, the purpose of this transformation was to `transform` the input `price` data into the `Gaussian` like probability distribution.\n",
    "3. Log Transformation: This transformation (performed using `np.log()` function) was used to calculate `Natural Logarithm` for each of the 'input data value' and transform the data based on those values.\n",
    "4. Z-Score Normalization: Calculating Z-Score (performed by using `StandardScaler()` function) is same as that of calculating `Standard Score`. This was carried out to determine exactly how far each `data point` was from the `mean value`.\n",
    "5. MinMax Normalization: This transformation (performed by using `MinMaxScaler()` function) is used when the values of attribute are on a `different scale` which could have resulted into a `poor prediction model` and it is precisely why `MinMax Normalisation` was used to bring all those values on the `same scale`.  \n",
    "6. Box-cox Transformation: To check whether the `non-normal distribution` had been `transformed` successfully, it is necessary to check the level of the `normality`, however, `box-cox` transformation, never checks for it, so the normality is `not guaranted`, and that is precisely where the `probability plot` comes into the picture, to verify the `normality`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these `suitable` transformation techniques were carried out on the `price` of each property, `distance from the nearest shopping center`,`minimum travel time to CBD`, and `distance from the nearest hospital` respectively. Some plots were also used in appropriate sections to display how the data looks after the transformation. In addition to this, separate dataframes were created to reflect the changes which have been made throughout the following sub-sections."

    "# 9. Conclusion\n",
    "I was given a total of `3` dataset files (`.zip files`), each of which contained several other sub-datasets. The first dataset named `dhrruvtokas.zip` contained `hospitals.xlsx`, `real_state.json`, `real_state.xlsx` ,`shoppingcenter.pdf`, and `supermarkets.html` respectively. These files were extracted from the `.zip` structure in the `section 3.1` and their data was later extracted in the `section 4.1`. The second dataset named `GTFS_Melbourne_Train_Information.zip` contained a total of `8 text files`, these files were `agency.txt`, `calendar.txt`, `calendar_dates.txt`, `routes.txt`, `shapes.txt`, `stop_times.txt`, `stops.txt`, and `trips.txt` respectively. These files were examined and extracted in the `section 5`. The last dataset named `vic_suburb_boundary.zip` contained a total of `4 shape files` which included `VIC_LOCALITY_POLYGON_shp.dbf`, `VIC_LOCALITY_POLYGON_shp.prj`, `VIC_LOCALITY_POLYGON_shp.shp`, and `VIC_LOCALITY_POLYGON_shp.shx` respectively. These files were later reviewed and were used in the later sections to estimate certain `distance values`. In the `section 7`, the required data was calaculated and extracted for each of the output columns. For each column, its extracted data set was then loaded into a dataframe, and all togethere these sums up to be `21 dataframes`. These dataframes were later `combined` into a `single dataframe` which was then converted into a single `CSV` formatted file (`dhrruvtokas_solution.csv`), and this was achieved in the `section 7.21`. After The data was `reshaped` (in `section 8`) by using a set of `Normalization/Transformation` techniques used in the same section, the `property price` of each property was successfully `predicted` and displayed using a `Linear Model`"
